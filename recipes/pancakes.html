    <h2>A Perfect Start to Your Morning</h2>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes 
        with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; 
            mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; 
            cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
