    <h2>A Great Way to Add Flavor to Your Day</h2>
    <p>This Thai basil fried rice is a staple of Thai cooking and a great use for leftover rice. Adjust the spices to your tastes. 
        I get Thai basil from a local Asian market. It has a different flavor than regular basil and makes all the difference in this recipe. 
        It is fast and fairly easy to make but requires constant stirring.</p><br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup peanut oil for frying</li>

        <li>2 serrano peppers, crushed</li>

        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked jasmine rice, chilled</li>
        <li>2 cups sweet Thai basil</li>
